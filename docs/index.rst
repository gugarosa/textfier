Welcome to Textfier's documentation!
=====================================

Dealing with text is not often a trivial task. Hence, this package provides a more straightforward interface to tackle text-based texts and modifications. Built on top of Huggingface's Transformers, Textfier is a wrapper focusing on the specific tasks we are currently researching.

Use Textifier if you need a library or wish to:

* Implement or use pre-defined tasks;
* Mix-and-match different approaches to solve problems;
* Because modifying text is fun.

Textfier is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.
